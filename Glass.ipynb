    "In order to make glass sustainability all that needs to be done it to recycle it.  Many advances have come along in the glass industry have increased the popularity of [insulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulated_glazing) and [low-e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_emissivity) windows.  Insulated windows have been around since before the 1930s in one form or another though they did not start becoming popular until around the 1950s.  The way these windows work is that there are two layers of glass (or lights) separated by a layer of gas.  Since the internal gas is confined between the two panes it moves very slowly if at all.  The greatly reduces the heat transfer from one pane to the other by convection.  Gases are made up of widely spaced atoms which reduces the ability of heat to be transfered via conduction.  This means that heat transfer by radiation becomes a mush more dominant form of loss.  This is where low-e glass comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-e stands for low emissivity which means the glass radiates energy less.  Emissivity is measures relative to a [blackbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) (a perfect emitter).  The reason for this is that a the amount of energy an object will emit is identical to the amount of energy that an object will absorb at a particular temperature and wavelength.  Just think of walking on hot asphalt and you'll get the idea.\n",

    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "How low-e glass is made is that the glass is coated with a thin reflective coating that prevents radiation from passing through the window.  Some of these coatings are fragile and can only be used if they are protected by being in the inside of insulated windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years there has been work done on a absorbing radiation rather than letting it pass through glass.  This is being done by collecting non-visible wavelengths and channeling them to solar cells that border the glass.  This is known as a [transparent luminescent solar concentrator](http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2014/solar-energy-that-doesnt-block-the-view/) or just [luminescent solar concentrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminescent_solar_concentrator) (LSC).  The idea is it use some of the radiation to make electricity rather than just have it heat up the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for recycling glass, for every ton of glass recycled it reduces the need for raw materials like sand by about 1,300 lbs, soda ash by 400 lbs, limestone by 400 lbs, and feldspar by 150 lbs.  It also reduces the amount of electricity needed by 42 kWh and the amount of pollution by 7.5 pounds (not including the ton of glass not thrown away) ([source](https://utahrecycles.org/get-the-facts/the-facts-glass/)).\n"

Unlike a crystalline material the atoms are arranged in a random pattern.  This means that small defects can cause great concentrations of stresses.  This fact is taken advantage of when cutting glass.  Glass is cut by making a small groove in the surface which causes an increase in localized stress and when the glass is bent it will break at that groove.\n",

    "In order to make modern glass sheets molten glass is poured on a pool of molten tin.  Because both materials are liquid and the tin is much heavier than the glass the glass forms a flat uniform thickness layer floating on top.  Historic glass was either drawn or blown which would leave ripples in the surface of the glass and depending on the process it was necessary to polish the surface prior to use."
