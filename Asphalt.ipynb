However, the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) is currently working on making asphalt greener.  The most traditional approach is recycling. Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) has been around for about 35 years, and more than 100 million tons of asphalt is reclaimed annually.  Most of this reclaimed asphalt is then recycled back into pavement.  In addition to this, recycled material from other industries like roofing shingles, and rubber from used tires is also incorporated into asphalt pavement.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [Asphalt Sustainability Report](https://www.asphaltpavement.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=493&Itemid=1058) that NAPA put out in 2009, if RAP usage is increased to 25 percent of the average mix design, it will reduce total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent ($\\approx$ 2,000,000 tons annually).  It should be noted that asphalt pavement is actually only 5 percent asphalt, and the rest is aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel).  This means that very little asphalt actually makes up pavement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with other materials, the majority of the greenhouse gases come from the processing of asphalt.  However, unlike other materials we have covered so far, there are other environmental impacts caused from the use of asphalt.  Some of these include heat retention (also known as the heat island effect), stormwater runoff due to impermeable surfaces, and emissions of other pollutants created during the processing of asphalt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The asphalt industry is either conducting research on, or actively trying to reduce the impacts of these problems on the environment.\n",

    "Asphalt is pavement is not considered a toxic substance per se.  It is basically an inert solid.  However, there are some health risks in its application due to the fact that it needs to be a liquid.  The majority of asphalt is applied hot, rather than mixed with a solvent (\"cutback\" mixes).  This means that it needs to be between 212 - 320$^\\circ$F to be applied.  At that temperature it's a burn hazard, but it also can produce hydrogen sulfide (H$_2$S).  Hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs, is like carbon monoxide in that it displaces oxygen, and can be toxic if in high enough concentrations. It is also mildly acidic, which means it can irritate the eyes and lungs.  It will react with iron to product iron sulfide, which is flammable at 130$^\\circ$F.  The quote below comes from an asphalt material safety data sheet (MSDS).\n",

Additionally, over time, heavy vehicle traffic leads to rutting on roads, which allows water to collect.  This becomes a driving hazard due to the potential of hydroplaning, and loss of control.  For these reasons a version of asphalt pavement has been developed, that is porous, and if placed over a stone recharge bed will allow for water to enter the ground without the need for retention ponds.\n",
