This is not as much as steel, but it weighs less, and is much cheaper.  Additionally, it is fire resistant; so much so that it is sometimes used to protect steel.  What you see in the video of a concrete cylinder being crushed (if available) is a sudden failure due to a cylinder being compressed.

    "The concept of self healing concrete is base on the concept of embedding a repair mechanism within the mix itself.  A student (*let me know if you want your name included*) within this construction materials class was interested in the topic and did research upon it.  This research yielded five different approaches, “chemical encapsulation, bacterial encapsulation, mineral admixtures, chemicals in glass tubing, and intrinsic self-healing”.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's discuss the motivation for self healing concrete.  As I will mention later, concrete placed in tension is generally one tenth as strong as concrete in compression.  To make up for this structural deficiency, concrete is typically designed in such a way that steel, placed within the concrete, carries the tension load.  Tension is commonly encountered in structures, in bending of beams for instance.  The reinforced concrete member, once placed in tension, will develop cracks.  Additionally, concrete shrinks as it ages, which can result in shrinkage cracks if the edges of the concrete are restrained.  The point is that cracks will occur in most concrete members during their regular usage.  When these cracks occur, if the concrete is exposed to water then the reinforcing steel in the concrete can become corroded. Corroding steel will expand, which will damage the concrete further, as well as reduce the tension carrying capacity of the reinforced concrete member.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these self healing approaches have yet lead to a widely adopted material, however research done using the bacterial encapsulation in the Netherlands has made some head way, and wound up in the news ([CNN report](http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/14/tech/bioconcrete-delft-jonkers/)).  This approach is similar to the other approaches in that it's goal is to prevent damage from being done to the reinforcing steel to start with.  To accomplish this, all of the approaches seek to fill cracks with a material that seals the steel off from the water.  The Netherlands approach use capsules filled with bacteria, and calcium lactate (a food source).  When a crack occurs, capsules that intersect the crack break releasing their contents.  If water then penetrates the crack then the bacteria then become active, consuming the calcium lactate, and producing limestone.  If the crack is small enough then this waste product can fill the crack and block any further flow of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the self healing approaches attempt to tackle to the problem of corrosion prevention in a similar fashion.  Cracking triggers a reaction that hopefully fills the very crack that started it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology will be beneficial in extending the lifespan of concrete structures, and in the future, as the techniques become more sophisticated, it will become more widely available.  Once it is, it can begin to reduce the production of green house gases by reducing the need to replace damaged concrete structures.  It should be noted that there are also potential benefits in the area of hazardous material containment using self healing concrete."

    "The steel reinforcing bars allow for beams to be able to crack and still be strong since the steel continues to carried the tension.  Additional techniques include using steel cables to prestress the concrete.  Prestressing refers to a member being placed in compression before being used in service.  If the prestressing is done carefully, then the side of the member that was going to be in tension will be placed in compression.  Once the service loading is applied, the tension will just lessen the pre-applied compression, and the member will still remain in compression.  This will prevent any cracking from forming since the member never goes into tension.  The ultimate effect is that the concrete element is stiffer and stronger making it unnecessary to use as large an element as would be necessary without prestressing.\n",

    "One last note, the strength of concrete will depend on how long it is kept moist while curing.  If it isn't kept moist the concrete will dry out, and there won't be sufficient water for the curing reactions to complete.  If concrete is steam cured, it will actually reach the maximum 28 day strength much sooner, due to the continuous moisture and additional heat.  This is one of the reasons precast plants often use steam curing, to increase production. "

    "Concrete is used in the industrial setting in many ways.  Obviously foundations for any structures but also some of the structures themselves.  Large holding tanks can be made from concrete.  Piping can be concrete.  Retention facilities like settling ponds can be concrete.  Anything that needs to be durable and/or exceptionally stable and strong is likely to contain a substantial amount of concrete.  \n",

    "Concrete is generally sold by the cubic yard or by the bag for small amounts.  Depending on the strength and aggregate used concrete can vary from \\$95 - \\$105 per cubic yard. ([source](http://www.everything-about-concrete.com/how-much-does-concrete-cost.html))  Buying concrete by the cubic yard is done when purchasing premixed or batch concrete.  This concrete is delivered from a batch plant via a ready mix truck, which is basically a large concrete mixer.  The fact that concrete cures instead of drying means that considerations need to be taken when ordering from a batch plant since the cure time starts at the plant.  Additives like curing retarders can be included in the mix, but they add cost, and there is a limit to what they can do.  It is interesting to note that on days that the temperature is high the concrete cures more quickly.  To limit the impact of high temperature some batch plants will add ice to the mix to reduce the temperature, and slow the curing process.\n",

    "I've digressed though, and need to mention that batch plant will generally have a minimum order amount, and a delivery fee.  Trucks hold approximately 10$~$yd$^3$s of concrete, and can be ordered to deliver over a period of time rather than all at once.  Depending on the rate of construction, and size of the project this could be as little as a few minutes apart, to close to an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you buy concrete buy the bag, you will need to mix it on site, which means you will have to have access to water that is suitable for mixing.  The mixing can be done via concrete mixer, or by hand if necessary.  Either way, batch plant, or on site mixing, you will likely need to place the concrete with additional equipment such as a pump, or wheelbarrow.  This will add additional costs to the project, and though the cost may be small, it should be considered.  In some situations a separate pump truck will have to be used, and that is not a minor expense."

    "It is possible that you might place small quantities of concrete yourself.  For a typical small job you would need at least a shovel, and a wheelbarrow to move the concrete around.  You would need finishing tools like a broom, concrete trowel and/or float, depending on the type of finish.  But probably most important of all, you need water.  Water for mixing, cleaning, and flushing you eyes, or skin if you got concrete on you.  Concrete is very caustic, and you'll need to wear gloves, and eye protection.  This is a substance that you are likely to trust too much.  You can work with it without electricity so safety can become a secondary thought; it shouldn't be.  If you are not careful when working with concrete you can develop a wound that can lead to blood poising, and even death.  Wear your safety equipment."

    "Concrete is one of those substances that you don't hear about in the news as a cause of failure.  Typically, if it is, it's due to poor engineering, or corroded reinforcement.  If you do hear about a concrete structure collapsing it is typically something under construction, somewhere that's hit by an earthquake, or the structure was impacted by a vehicle, or a bomb.  Concrete is tough, and since it's cheap, concrete structures have a tendency to be over designed.  Code requires an additional factor of safety in the design of concrete structures because of its brittle nature.  This is why you are more likely to hear about a steel structure collapsing, because it can be built so much closer to the limit of the material's strength."
