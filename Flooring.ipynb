Specifically we are going to be covering tile, wood flooring, and resilient flooring (vinyl, cork and the like).  The tile we are looking at is ceramic tile as apposed to natural stone tile.  The installation technique is very similar but the usage specifics will vary based on which type of stone is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get too far along we should cover the sustainability aspects of flooring.  Since we are focusing on ceramic tile to start with, I can say that the manufacturing process is similar to brick except that tile are much thinner.  That mean the embodied energy is proportional, and durability is similar.  As such, tile can be recycled if, and it is a big if, they can be removed without breaking.  Depending on your local recycling center, they can be mixed in with brick, or concrete recycling, and their reuse (in a ruble form) would be similar to concrete and brick.\n",

    "Real wood flooring has something of a market, particularly if it is antique.  It is not unusual to find people, contractors, or companies, that will come in and remove the old flooring for you, if there is a resale market for it.  Otherwise it can be recycled just like other wood components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though I'm not going to be covering it much, flooring made from rapid growing plants such as bamboo is available, and because of its rapid grow, it can be more sustainable than new growth wood flooring.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a smaller market for resilient flooring and as such the sustainability aspects of it comes from its source.  There are floorings that are comercially available made from recycled content, like flooring made from recycled tires and other scrap rubber."

    "On to tiles.  We are going to be discussing glazed wall tiles, ceramic mosaic tiles, quarry tiles, and paver tiles.  All tiles are abrasion resistant and come in a variety of textures and colors.  Because of their firing process they also have a high resistance to moisture.  Some versions have additional properties making them chemical resistant and even electrically conductive (which is useful in certain applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiles are relatively simple to install.  They are essentially “glued” in place using either a version of portland cement mortar, a resin based mortar, or an organic based mastic adhesive.  This makes them a popular finish for flooring.  Based on the type of tile, and fastening material, they can be used in both interior and exterior applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology of tile (being equivalent to that of brick) dates back to around 5,000 B.C. to 3,000 B.C. (depending on your definition of tile).  Though some of the earliest decorative tile were found in Egypt, the technology was developed further in Greece, and later in Italy.  Glazes improved with the introduction of additional techniques using white clay ([source](http://rbctile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/History-of-Tile-101-Part-1.pdf)) inspired by the Chinese in the 12th century.  In 1863 William Boulton patented a technique in England where he used clay dust to create multi-color tiles without the use of colored glazing.  This method was in use in the U.S. by the end of the 19th century.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with other materials, the tile industry has spawned an organization that promotes the use of tile and provides guidelines for its use.  The [Tile Council of America](http://www.tcnatile.com/about-us.html) (TCA) was established in 1945  and has actively sponsored research into adhesives and mortars.  This research has resulted in many of the most common tiling techniques used in the modern construction industry.  Information on these techniques can be found in the [Handbook for Ceramic Tile Installation](http://www.tcnatile.com/products-and-services/publications/218-english-publications/188-handbook.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of adhesive or motar used affect the level of moisture resistance of the finished surface.  The level of moisture resistance of the tiles themselves can be broken down into two groups and these have subcategories. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suitable for continuous water exposure and freeze thaw exposure.\n",
    "    * impervious – less than 0.5% moisture absorption. \n",
    "    * vitreous – from 0.5% -  3% moisture absorption.\n",
    "2. Not suitable for continuous water exposure nor freeze thaw exposure.\n",
    "    * semivitreous – from 3% – 7% moisture absorption.\n",
    "    * nonvitreous – from 7% - 18% moisture absorption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, tiles only come in two grades, standard and seconds.  Standard is the best quality available while seconds, though free from structural defects, can have cosmetic defects which are apparent while still at a distance greater than 3 feet."

    "Glazed wall tiles are typically square tiles with edges measuring 4 to 4 $\\frac{1}{4}$” and are from $\\frac{1}{4}$” to $\\frac{5}{16}$” in thickness.  The glazing on wall tiles can be purely decorative, but some variations of it can be durable enough that the tile could be used on the floor in light traffic situations.  The tiles that are capable of being used on the floor will have a heavier glaze with a crystalline, or matte finish.  To be clear, floor tile can also be used on the wall, but wall tile is typically lighter, and thus easier to place.\n",

    "Mortar is the “glue” that sticks the tile to the working surface.  Depending on the type of mortar used, the surface of the mortar may need to be textured.  This texture is achieved with the use of specialized tools, like a notched trowel.  It is important to match the texture of the mortar to the requirements of the tile.  Smaller tile will require a finer texture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The mortar used for setting tile generally falls into one of the following seven types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Portland cement mortar – needs to be in a layer about 1” thick for floors, and no less than $\\frac{3}{4}$” for walls.  If glazed tiles are used, they will typically need to be presoaked.  Because of the bed (short for motar bed) thickness, it can be used to level, or smooth irregular surfaces.  However, it cannot be used by itself.  Rather motar needs to include metal lath, or mesh for reinforcement, and it needs to be placed over a cleavage membrane.  Cleavage membranes are used to provide a shear break, allowing for independently movement during shrinkage.\n",
    "* Dry-set mortar – Though it needs to be moist cured for three days, is recommended for heavy duty floors.  It is impact resistant, and like the portland cement mortar, is fire resistant.  It needs to be in a layer, from 1/16” to $\\frac{1}{4}$” thick.  Unlike portaland cement mortar, if glazed tiles are used with it, they do not need to be presoaked.  Finally, it should not be place directly on wood.\n",
    "* Latex-portland cement mortar – Needs to be placed in a layer from $\\frac{1}{8}$” to $\\frac{1}{4}$” thick, and only can be used over concrete.  It does have an increased bond strength over plane portland cement mortar, due to the latex additive.\n",
    "* Epoxy mortar – This take skilled labor to use due to the limited work time, and care needed in mixing the chemicals that make up the exoxy.  It only needs to be placed in a layer from $\\frac{1}{16}$” to $\\frac{1}{8}$” thick, however it is not suitable for use on walls.  Prior to setting up, it can be cleaned up using water.  It can be placed over just about any rigid surface, including plywood.  Some of the other benefits include the fact that it is both chemical, and water resistant.\n",
    "* Epoxy adhesives – Though less expensive than epoxy mortar, it is more versicle, and it can be used on walls.  However, it does have the same drawbacks in terms of work time, and required skill.  It is also less chemical resistant than epoxy mortar, but it is still better than mastic.\n",
    "* Furan mortar – This has the same limitations as epoxy mortar, but it is more chemically resistant.  This means it is very useful in corrosive environments, or any place where there is going to be a lot of chemical exposure.\n",
    "* Organic (mastic adhesive) – Not good for external use, or anywhere in continuous contact with water, since it does not cure, but rather it hardens due to evaporation.  It is good for light duty floors, or walls, and comes in ready to use varieties.  It needs to be applied in a $\\frac{1}{16}$” layer over smooth backing.  It does have one key advantage, it remains more flexible than any of the previous mortars mentioned.  Making it less subseptible to failure due to diferential movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the placement of tile in the motar, it's important to maintain uniform joint widths.  The joints between the tiles will vary based on the type of tile used.  Some tile will have either built in spacers, like some glazed wall tiles, or will be held apart like mosaic.  If the spacing is not predefined by the tile, then it will be important to control the spacing.  There are rubber spacers available for this purpose, but they need to be removed once the tile have been placed. Alternatively, the tile can be placed using layout lines, and sighted, if using skilled labor.  Joint sizes are roughly $\\frac{1}{16}$”, for 2” and smaller tile, and increases about $\\frac{1}{16}$” for every 1” of tile size, give or take $\\frac{1}{8}$”.

    "One more thing about tile.  Since tile comes in small units relative to the size of the floor, it is tempting to simply start laying tile in one corner, and working out from there.  This is technically possible to do, but it will often lead to the tile along one or two walls looking good, while where it meets all other walls it looks irregular, or even broken.  In order to provide the best final results tile needs to arranged from a centerline of the entire space to be covered.  For the final product, it is best to plan on having as close to half a tile at the edges as possible.  If you have an irregularly shaped space, pick the longest continuous edge to be parallel to the baseline. Next, pick the longest edge that is approximately perpendicular to that baseline.  This wall will be approximately parallel to the perpendicular baseline.\n",

    "It is only guaranteed that the baseline is parallel to the longest wall.  The perpendicular baseline only needs to be perpendicular to the baseline, and centered in the space between the longest perpendicular wall and its opposing dominate wall.  The reason this is the case is that unless you are working in a new building, and it has been erected perfectly, there is a strong possibility that the two longest walls will not be perpendicular to each other.  Since most tiles are arranged on a perpendicular grid you will need to establish perpendicular reference lines to lay the tile to.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither baseline intersects the edge containing the entrance to the space, consider centering one of the baselines such that it does intersect that edge.  To do this you would need to redefine the longest wall as a shorter wall. The criteria for making this choice is to only do so if the length, of what would become the new longest wall, is no more than 10% shorter than the original longest wall choice.  Since this is a compromise from the optimal choice, use your best judgment, or contact the architect, or owner to see which of the two choices would be most visually prominent."

    "Wood flooring comes in two main varieties, hardwood and softwood.  Hardwood consists of oak, maple, beech ans birch.  Softwood flooring is southern pine, douglas fir, or west coast hemlock.  The terms hardwood and softwood are not really descriptive of the material properties but oak has been known to be more wear resistant. \n",
    "\n",
    "The appearance of the flooring, with regard to grain, depends on if the flooring was made from flat sawn or quarter sawn lumber.  In quarter sawn the grain will be viewed from the edge on and thus will appear to be a series of parallel (if not straight) lines.  Flat sawn will have grain patterns that appear to form loops and large curves.  Aside from aesthetics the only advantage of one over the other is that quarter sawn lumber will be more resistant to changes in humidity, though all wood flooring should be protected from moisture.\n",

    "Floor boards will interlock with the use of edge joints known as tongue-and-groove (T&G).  The tongue consists of a protrusion of about $\\frac{1}{4}$” for the middle third of the board and the grove is a notch a little more than $\\frac{1}{4}$” on the middle third on the back of the board.  These two surfaces will mate together making the floor boards move together when subjected to a vertical load.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional floor is fastened down fastened down by nailing at an angle through the tongue to conceal the fasteners.  This is known as blind nailing.  This technique allows for the wear surface to be sanded down and refinished if it becomes damaged.  Generally this can be done about three times before the nails begin to become exposed.  Floors that are face nailed instead of blind nailed cannot be refinished in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wood flooring comes in a variety of sizes, especially if you include modern wood composite flooring.  The modern flooring generally comes prefinished which means far less time needed before it can be used.  The application of these finishes can be much better controlled in factory settings but there is generally a substantially reduced ability to refinish the floor after it is installed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The modern prefinished wood flooring is also installed differently.  Generally it is a quicker installation procedure and does not require as long of an acclimation time which also increases its popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of flooring will generally have a 4 to 6 mil polyethylene film (or equivalent) under them to prevent moisture from causing warping or buckling due to expansion.  One other technique used to prevent buckling is that wood flooding is generally kept from $\\frac{1}{2}$” to $\\frac{3}{4}$” away from the surrounding walls.  This gap allows for movement due to temperature and moisture content changes in the flooring."

    "Resilient flooring is a type of flooring that consists of dense, thin material that is nonabsorbent and resistant to damage from normal use.  Modern resilient flooring generally consists of vinyl tile, vinyl sheeting, rubber tile, cork tile, and linoleum though there are others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleum\"> <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Linoleum_003.jpg/240px-Linoleum_003.jpg\" alt = \"Linoleum image\" Title=\"Linoleum Flooring\"  style=\"max-width:200px; max-height:200px; border:1px solid blue; float:left; margin-right:10px;\"/></a>\n",
    "The oldest of these, linoleum, is actually the first type of resilient flooring developed.  It was invented by Englishman [Frederick Walton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Walton) in 1855 but it wasn't until 1864 was the material the is what is recognized today.  This is a sheet material made from oxidized linseed oil binders and cork flour filler bound to a burlap of felt backing.  Being made from natural products it is considered a green material.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_%28material%29\"> <img src=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1-Arraiolos-0050.jpg\" alt = \"Cork oak bark image\" Title=\"Cork Oak Bark\"  style=\"max-width:300px; max-height:300px; border:1px solid blue; float:right; margin-left:10px;\"/></a>\n",
    "Cork tile is also considered green since the majority of the material comes from harvesting cork from the cork oak and does not involve the killing of the tree.  The cork is part of the bark of the Cork Oak and can be harvested once every 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vinyl is short for [polyvinyl chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride) (PVC) which is an artificial thermoplastic polymer.  Depending on how much plasticizer is used it can be made very flexible and is commonly used as a coating for wire.  It can be mixed with other materials to make tiles or sheeting like linoleum.  Vinyl can also be made clear to act as a wear surface protecting the colored or patterned layer.  Because of the durability of vinyl it can have a wear surface as thin as 0.01” thick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubber tile can be made from either natural or synthetic rubber.  It is reinforced with clay and fibrous talc.  Plasticizers and pigments are added to the rubber along with chemicals to speed the curing process.  Once rolled to the correct thickness (approx. $\\frac{1}{8}$” to $\\frac{3}{16}$” thick) the ingredients are heat treated to vulcanize it.  The result is a smooth glossy finish that is then cut into tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "All resilient flooring are expected to be placed with adhesive to fix them in place.  However in some applications some resilient flooring can be placed by simply fastening the edges down.  The reason for this is to speed future replacement.  It is known as a tension floor.  It is important that the surface that the flooring is being applied over is stable and free of moisture and dust.  The adhesives used need to be either epoxy or solvent base mastics to be able to withstand the stresses place on the connection.  Additionally if this method is used then care must be taken when moving heavy objects since they can rip the flooring.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using resilient flooring you must make sure that the surface is adequately prepared.  This means that the floor must be smooth, clean, and stable.  This is because resilient flooring is flexible and will contour to the subfloor.  If there are sharp edges, these will quickly become places where the flooring becomes damaged.  If the subfloor is not clean then the flooring adhesive may break loose and dramatically reduce the floor's life expectancy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One last note, back in the 1920s to 1980s some vinyl resilient flooring was made that contained asbestos.  If you are working on a project that dates from then and it has resilient flooring be aware that [abatement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos_abatement) may be necessary, particularly if the floor is going to be disturbed."
