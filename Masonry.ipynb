    "The term masonry covers concrete blocks, bricks, stone work, and even glass block.  To generalize it is any work done where elements are assembled by means of laying with the application of mortar.  Mortar is a mixture of a cementitious product and well-graded sand.  There are a variety types of mortar and numerous sizes and styles of blocks and bricks.  I've shown just a small sample of brick sizes below.

    "There are also different terms for the same type of brick (or block) depending on its orientation in a wall.  It is important to be familiar with terms like Stretcher, Header, Soldier, Sailor, Rowlock and Shiner ([description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brickwork#Orientation), [in wall image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Brick_terms.jpg)).  Additionally a modular brick has holes in it to allow for more even firing vs. non-modular (or common) which is a solid brick.  \n",

What we are going to try to cover about masonry is a similar level of details that we have covered for the other materials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a little history.  Brick construction has been around since at least 6,000 B.C. in the form of sun-dried bricks and some sources put that date closer to 7,500 B.C.  The discovery of brick firing allowed the creation of a more durable product.  The process of firing actually fuses the clay particles that make up the brick together.\n",

Palmer.  These consist of portland cement, water, aggregates and admixtures, in some cases.  Once consolidated and unmolded these are commonly steam cured.  This allows for rapid gaining of strength.  A listing of the sizes and shapes that are commonly available can be found [here](http://www.alliedconcrete.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/CMU-Catalog.pdf).\n",

    "The Brick Industry Association released a Technical Note with the title [Sustainability and Brick](http://gobrick.com/Portals/25/docs/Technical%20Notes/TN48.pdf) in June of 2009.  In the Summary Of Recommendations they listed following seven points to move the industry towards sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Sustainable design balances environmental, economic and societal goals. It is more than just a certification from a rating system\n",
    ">2. Brick is made from abundant natural resources (clay and shale) and is readily recycled for use in the manufacturing process or other uses\n",
    ">3. Brick manufacturers address sustainability by locating plants in close proximity to mines; incorporating waste products and recycled materials into brick; reducing energy use, water use and atmospheric emissions; and utilizing landfill gas and other wastes for fuel\n",
    ">4. Brickwork used in sustainable designs can provide structure, finish, acoustic comfort, thermal comfort, good indoor air quality, fire resistance, impact resistance and durability, all in one product\n",
    ">5. Brickwork can help meet requirements of many certification rating systems in the areas of development density, storm water management, heat island effect, improved energy performance, building reuse, construction waste management, materials reuse, recycled content and regional materials\n",
    ">6. Brickwork can contribute to improved indoor air quality by eliminating the need for paints and the resulting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and by eliminating a food source for mold\n",
    ">7. Brickwork is durable, having a life expectancy of hundreds of years. Brick buildings can be and are reused, thereby distributing their environmental impact over an extended life span\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these seven, number seven is one of the best arguments for for sustainability.  Reuse of existing structures does effectively reduce their environmental impact.  This argument can also be made for other structures and as some of you are future contractors this should be something you should keep in that back of your mind when trying to get a project certified as sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The North West Concrete Masonry Association (NWCMA) published a technical note (TEK) on [Concrete Masonry and Sustainable Design are a Natural Fit](http://www.nwcma.org/pdfs/concrete-masony-and-sustainable-design.pdf) in 2010.  In it there were seven points arguing for the sustainable aspects of concrete masonry units on the following topics.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Longevity and Durability\n",
    ">2. Resource Efficiency\n",
    ">3. Byproduct Utilization\n",
    ">4. Energy Efficiency\n",
    ">5. Safety and Protection\n",
    ">6. Aesthetics\n",
    ">7. Enclosure and Finish\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections relating to each of these points they layout how CMUs can be used in a LEED certified project.  The final point in the paper they site a quote that echos the Brick Industry Association's final point,\n",
    "\n",
    ">“It is likely the environmental impact is much less if we build one 75-year building rather than three 25-year buildings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The point being that a built structure embodies a lot of energy and by building for the long term the impact can be minimized."

    "Bricks and blocks have high thermal mass and are fire resistant.  They typically do not require painting and as such reduce the cost of maintenance.  If constructed appropriately masonry walls can have similar resistance to wind borne debris as concrete walls.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Modern brick walls are typically not structural.  Rather brick is simply a veneer attached to the skeleton of the structure.  Block walls can be more easily made structural with the addition of steel reinforcing and grout which is a type of concrete.  The grout is poured around the steel inside cavities in the block wall; bonding the steel and block together.\n",

[Fire brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_brick) is a type of brick that was manufactured specifically to resist high temperatures.  Some of these bricks can resist temperatures of up to 3,000 $^\\circ$F.  Chemical resistant brick or [acid brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_brick) is a type of brick specifically created to resist damage from acids.  It must be laid with the use of a special mortar that does not contain portland cement and the mortar joints are typically much smaller than regular brick construction.  It is used in environments where acid vapors are present or as a lining of tanks and piping.  These types of environments can show up in paper mills, power plants, waste treatment facilities, etc.  \n",

Because concrete blocks are mostly made from portland cement and aggregate there is potential to vary the mixture of the block to obtain different properties.

    "Grout is not the same thing as mortar and the two can not be used interchangeably.  Grout needs to be rather thin (high fluidity) in order to flow into the narrow spaces surrounding the reinforcing steel in masonry walls.  It should have a slump around 8-10 inches to do this.  The strength of grout typically runs between 600 and 2,500 psi though it can exceed this if water is absorbed from it into the surrounding masonry.  \n",

Strength test mortar samples are not cylindrical in shape but rather [small cubes](http://ncma-br.org/pdfs/68/TEK%2018-05B.pdf) measuring 2\" on each side.  Samples may need to be taken if water retention, air content, or even bond strength is specified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However if the wall strength is specified ($f'_m$) it is more likely that a prism will be used to determine the strength of the wall composite.  A prism is a small built up unit that is made from the masonry units, mortared together and filled with grout.  This whole unit is then tested in compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using a prism instead of testing the individual components is that if you test the components you would need to account for the differing Poison's ratios' effect on the strength of the system.  Additionally you would need to account for the bond strengths' contribution to the wall strength.  Finally using a prism incorporates the effect of the mason's skill in assembly.\n",

    "Unreinforced masonry will fail if it is subjected to moderate lateral loading.  The reason for this is the same as for unreinforced concrete; as the wall is put into bending one side will develop tension.  Being a brittle material either the bonds between mortar and unit break, or the mortar or units will themselves break.  This leads to the inevitable collapse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For reinforced masonry it is desirable that the units rather than the mortar fails.  This does not mean using the highest strength mortar available though since the interaction of the Poisson's ratios' of the unit and mortar will have a substantial impact on $f'_m$.  If the mortar strength it too high it will actually fail first due to this interaction.  However if the wall is designed properly there will be substantial yielding of the steel reinforcement and cracking showing before the collapse of a wall."

    "Masonry can be damaged by repeated exposure to moisture, and/or a freeze thaw cycle.

Moisture infiltration can lead to mold and thus is a form of failure.  \n",

    "A critically important failure mode is caused by the lack of control joints.  These are gaps in walls filled with a flexible material where the sections of a wall can expand or contract from in a controlled manor.  Since brick will expand over time due to moisture absorption and CMUs will contract due to shrinkage of the concrete these gaps are extremely important.  Even the expansion and contraction of a wall due to temperature changes from day to night could cause a continuous wall to tear itself apart.  These control joint are typically from 15 to 25 feet apart and will be closer in walls with openings.  These joints will be both in the vertical and horizontal directions.\n",
